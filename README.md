-SKILLS USED-
* JavaScript
* Github

-PROJECT OVERVIEW-
* For this project I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.
* I added customized and conditional behavior and interactivity.
* I programmed a form that validates user *(in real time for email field, see below)*.
* My program provides helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields *(conditional error messages for email field, see below)*.
* After completing this project, I have a solid foundational knowledge of using and customizing forms in your projects.

EMAIL INPUT INCLUDES REAL TIME VALIDATION AND 2 ERROR MESSAGES:

  * VALID : email@example.com (No Hint Displayed)

  * DEFAULT ERROR (1) : If an @ symbol is present but doesn't meet valid input
                            requirement it displays "Email address must be formatted correctly"

  * ERROR 2 : If there is no @ symbol present in the input it displays
                  "Email must contain one @"
